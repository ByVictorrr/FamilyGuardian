### **1. Functional Requirements**
#### **Camera Integration**
- Connect and interface with Reolink cameras using the [Reolink API library](https://github.com/ReolinkCameraAPI/reolinkapipy).
- Retrieve real-time video feeds or snapshots for processing.
- Support multiple Reolink cameras if more than one is connected.

#### **Facial Recognition**
- Identify individuals using a database of known family members.
- Detect and classify faces in real-time or from captured frames.
- Notify when an unfamiliar face is detected.

#### **Notification and Alerts**
- Send immediate notifications (via email, SMS, or app) when an unfamiliar face is detected.
- Include a snapshot of the unfamiliar face in the alert.
- Provide the time and location (camera name) of the detection.

#### **Logging and Reporting**
- Maintain a log of all detected faces, including timestamps, camera details, and recognition status.
- Generate periodic reports (e.g., daily or weekly) summarizing:
  - Total detections.
  - Recognized vs. unrecognized faces.
  - Frequent visitors.

#### **Web Interface or App**
- Provide a simple UI to:
  - View real-time camera feeds.
  - Manage the database of known family members (upload photos or add profiles).
  - Review logs and reports.
- Allow authorized users to flag false positives or confirm unknown individuals.

#### **Performance and Reliability**
- Ensure low-latency video processing for real-time detection.
- Handle intermittent network connectivity gracefully.
- Automatically retry camera connections if they fail.

### **2. Non-Functional Requirements**
#### **System Setup**
- Deploy the application on a Raspberry Pi 5 cluster for high availability.
- Support PoE (Power-over-Ethernet) setups for connected cameras.

#### **Scalability**
- Be capable of handling additional cameras and larger datasets of known faces.

#### **Security**
- Securely store family members’ face data.
- Encrypt communication between the cameras and the application.
- Allow access only to authorized users (e.g., password-protected UI).

#### **Compatibility**
- Work with Reolink cameras and support the Reolink API.
- Ensure compatibility with Raspbian or another lightweight Linux-based OS.

#### **Usability**
- User-friendly interface for non-technical users (e.g., your dad).
- Provide clear and actionable notifications and reports.

---

### **3. Required Libraries and Tools**
#### **Programming Language**
- Python for easy integration with the Reolink API and facial recognition libraries.

#### **Facial Recognition**
- Use a library like **Face Recognition** (built on dlib) or **DeepFace** for recognizing faces.
- Support for adding and updating a database of known faces.

#### **Notifications**
- Libraries for sending alerts:
  - Email: `smtplib` or a third-party service like SendGrid.
  - SMS: Twilio API or similar.
  - Push notifications: Firebase or Pushover.

#### **Web Interface**
- Flask or Django for backend API and web application.
- Bootstrap or similar for a simple, responsive UI.

#### **Camera Integration**
- [Reolink API Python wrapper](https://github.com/ReolinkCameraAPI/reolinkapipy) for interacting with the cameras.

### **4. Workflow Requirements**
1. **System Setup**:
   - Install the FamilyGuardian application on the Raspberry Pi cluster.
   - Connect Reolink cameras to the local network.
   - Configure each camera’s IP address and API credentials in the application.

2. **Database Initialization**:
   - Populate the family members' face database with photos of known individuals.

3. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Continuously fetch frames from Reolink cameras.
   - Perform facial recognition on detected faces.
   - Log and classify results.

4. **Alerting**:
   - Trigger notifications for unfamiliar faces.
   - Allow users to review and update the family database.

5. **Reporting**:
   - Generate and display summary reports in the UI.
   - Provide an export option for logs and statistics.

---

### **5. Hardware Requirements**
- **Reolink Camera**: E.g., Reolink RLC-510A (with PoE support).
- **Raspberry Pi 5 Cluster**:
  - At least one node for the main server and processing.
  - Additional nodes for distributed processing if necessary.
- **PoE Switch**: For powering and networking the Reolink cameras.
- **Storage**: External or onboard storage for logs, reports, and face databases.

---

### **6. Optional Features**
- **Mobile App**:
  - Notifications with the ability to mark or label detections directly from the app.
- **Geo-Fencing**:
  - Disable alerts for familiar faces when family members are expected at home.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Train a custom model to improve detection accuracy for low-light or challenging scenarios.
